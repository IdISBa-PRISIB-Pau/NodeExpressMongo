Exercise (Instructions): Basic Authentication
Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will use basic authentication approach to authenticate users. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

    Set up an Express server to handle basic authentication
    Use the basic access authentication approach to do basic authentication.

Setting up Basic Authentication

    You will continue with the Express REST API server that you have been working on in the previous module in the conFusionServer folder.
    Open the app.js file and update its contents as follows:
    
    . . .

function auth (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.headers);
  var authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader) {
      var err = new Error('You are not authenticated!');
      res.setHeader('WWW-Authenticate', 'Basic');
      err.status = 401;
      next(err);
      return;
  }

  var auth = new Buffer.from(authHeader.split(' ')[1], 'base64').toString().split(':');
  var user = auth[0];
  var pass = auth[1];
  if (user == 'admin' && pass == 'password') {
      next(); // authorized
  } else {
      var err = new Error('You are not authenticated!');
      res.setHeader('WWW-Authenticate', 'Basic');      
      err.status = 401;
      next(err);
  }
}

app.use(auth);


    Save the changes and start the server. Access the server from a browser by opening an incognito window and see the result.
    Do a Git commit with the message "Basic Authentication".

Conclusions

In this exercise you learnt about performing basic authentication with username and password in a browser.
